				<h3 class="title">Hello world!</h3>
				<p>My name is Sandra, and I'm a developer, data connoisseur and hackothonista.</p>
				<p>I have been coding for 5+ years and built a few cool projects over the years, see below:</p>
			</section>

			<section class="examples">
				<div class="example">
					<h3>Logan is listening <span>2018</span></h3>
					<h4>side project</h3>
					<p>A data project for understanding community trends in Logan via utilising 3rd party apis and projecting findings to a live feed in a web app.</p>
					<p>I've used <strong>node.js</strong>, <strong>express</strong>, <strong>socket.io</strong> and vanilla Javascript to create a full-stack project. On the front end, I have used <strong>Chart.js</strong> to show live events for suburbs in Logan.</p>

					<h3>Cycling routes Brisbane <span>2018</span></h3>
					<h4>hackathon project</h3>
					<p>During the ARRB Data hackathon, I have solved a challenge in the 'Cycling' and 'Safety' challenges based on open datasets. This project received a <strong>2nd prize</strong> at the hackathon.</p>
					<p>I've built a <strong>Machine Learning</strong> model that would predict the risky sections for a given route for a cyclist based on historical data. I used <strong>python</strong> and <strong>jupyter notebooks</strong> for feature engineering and <strong>AWS AutoML</strong> to quickly create and iterate on models.</p>
					<p>Later on, a complete <strong>data pipeline</strong> and <strong>UI</strong> was added to the project, to make the whole user flow seamless.</p>
					<p><em>Note: currently the pipeline is turned off because of the pricing model of AWS WorkMail.</em></p>

					<h3>Future you. <span>2017 - 2018</span></h3>
					<h4>GetFU Holdings</h3>
					<p>As a <strong>full-stack software engineer</strong>, I have been working on FU, a money management product for millenials. It has been a truly exciting journey during which I've learnt a lot about <strong>AWS</strong>, and particulary about <strong>serverless</strong> frameworks and <strong>building datapipelines</strong> with it. On the front end, I have used <strong>React</strong> with <strong>Redux</strong>.</p>

					<h3>Jenny, the chatbot <span>2017</span></h3>
					<h4>hackathon project</h3>
					<p>At the Big Data Big Heart Hackathon participants were asked to create solutions for non-profits and organisations serving Queensland residents in various health related matters. Our chosen organisation was Epilepsy Queensland.</p>
					<p>As their work highly relies on communicating effectively with those who need it most, we have created a <strong>chatbot</strong> that aims to be a first point of reference on the website, especially out of office hours.</p>
					<p>I was mainly contributing by <strong>ideation</strong>, <strong>project management</strong>and <strong>user testing</strong>. We have received a special mention for this project.</p>
