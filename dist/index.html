				<h3 class="title">Hello world!</h3>
				<p>My name is Sandra, and I'm a developer, data connoisseur and hackothonista.</p>
				<p>I have been coding for 5+ years and built a few cool projects over the years, see below:</p>
			</section>

			<section class="examples">
				<div class="example">
					<h3>Logan is listening <span>2018</span></h3>
					<h4>side project</h3>
					<p>A data project for understanding community trends in Logan via utilising 3rd party apis and projecting findings to a live feed in a web app.</p>
					<p>I used <strong>node.js</strong>, <strong>express</strong>, <strong>socket.io</strong> and vanilla Javascript to create a full-stack project. On the front end, I used <strong>Chart.js</strong> to show live events for suburbs in Logan.</p>

					<h3>Cycling routes Brisbane <span>2018</span></h3>
					<h4>hackathon project</h3>
					<p>During the ARRB Data hackathon, I solved a challenge in the 'Cycling' and 'Safety' challenges based on open datasets. This project received a <strong>2nd prize</strong> at the hackathon.</p>
					<p>I've built a <strong>Machine Learning</strong> model that would predict the risky sections for a given route for a cyclist based on historical data. I used <strong>python</strong> and <strong>jupyter notebooks</strong> for feature engineering and <strong>AWS AutoML</strong> to quickly create and iterate on models.</p>
					<p>Later on, a complete <strong>data pipeline</strong> and <strong>UI</strong> was added to the project, to make the whole user flow seamless.</p>
					<p><em>Note: currently the pipeline is turned off because of the pricing model of AWS WorkMail.</em></p>

					<h3>Future you. <span>2017 - 2018</span></h3>
					<h4>GetFU Holdings</h3>
					<p>As a <strong>full-stack software engineer</strong>, I have been working on FU, a money management product for millenials. It has been a truly exciting journey during which I've learnt a lot about <strong>AWS</strong>, and particulary about <strong>serverless</strong> frameworks and <strong>building data pipelines</strong> with it. On the front end, I have used <strong>React</strong> with <strong>Redux</strong> and <strong>styled components</strong>.</p>

					<h3>Jenny, the chatbot <span>2017</span></h3>
					<h4>hackathon project</h3>
					<p>At the Big Data Big Heart Hackathon participants were asked to create solutions for non-profits and organisations serving Queensland residents in various health related matters. Our chosen organisation was Epilepsy Queensland.</p>
					<p>As their work highly relies on communicating effectively with those who need it most, we created a <strong>chatbot</strong> that aims to be a first point of reference on the website, especially out of office hours.</p>
					<p>I was mainly contributing by <strong>ideation</strong>, <strong>project management</strong> and <strong>user testing</strong>. We received a special mention for this project.</p>

					<h3>Hausus <span>2017</span></h3>
					<h4>remote contract</h3>
					<p>As a <strong>front end web developer</strong>, I worked remotely with a UK based startup that challenged the rental property market by connecting home owners with renters without the middle man.</p>
					<p>I worked in <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Sass</strong> to create the owner-side admin system for managing applications and properties.</p>

					<h3>You are my sunshine <span>2017</span></h3>
					<h4>hackathon project</h3>
					<p>At the Perth chapter of the global NASA SpaceApps Challenge, we worked on a solution for the solar energy challenge. Based on <strong>open data</strong>, we built a simulation of the energy intake and output of a family home in Perth with solars on it. The idea was that with the right smart home infrastructure, we would incentivise consumers to live a more energy-savvy lifestyle.</p>
					<p>I used <strong>React</strong> to create the simulation UI. The project received a <strong>1st prize</strong> and a nomination for global round.</p>

					<p>I used cutting edge front end technologies such as <strong>ES6</strong>, <strong>GSAP</strong> and in-app <strong>AfterEffects</strong> animations. The toolkit was built on atomic design principles.</p>
